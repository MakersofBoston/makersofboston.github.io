Yesterday, Apple announced the much anticipated [iPhone 5][2]. The Blogosphere has been atwitter for months, speculating about every possible feature to be included in this latest iteration. The rumors included a larger screen, new aluminum casing, and LTE. Much to the dismay of many of these bloggers, they were exactly right. Since everyone and their mother already knew exactly what was coming, it has left a [bad][3] [taste][4] in many blogger's mouths.

There is one feature, however, that has slipped through the cracks. A feature that could signal a massive shift in strategy for Apple in the future. There might have been more fanfare if Apple's Senior VP of iOS Software Scott Forstall spent more than (literally) 60 seconds talking about it. If you fast forward to 46:37 in the keynote [video][5], you'll see a new feature called "Shared Photo Stream"

## This is a heading

Shared Photo Stream is simple enough, grab a selection of photos and send them along to friends or family. What's really interesting is that those people who you share the photos with have the ability to comment on and like the photos. Sound familiar? With the announcement of a brand new Facebook [integration][6] in iOS 6, Apple has seemingly snuck in a direct Facebook competitor within the same release. Apple recently [announced][7] that they were shutting down their failed music social network Ping, so it makes perfect sense for them to attempt to restart their foray into social networking with a photo sharing app. After all, photo sharing was arguably the killer app that lead to Facebook's wild success in the first place.

So is Apple planning on beating the social media giants at their own game? Only time will tell...
